# /goal — Book III, Part VII: Support Vector Machines

**Agent ID:** B3-P07 | **Branch:** `feature/book-iii-part-vii-svm` | **Chapters:** III-32–III-34

**Mission:** Show separating hyperplanes, maximum margins, violations, support vectors and kernel similarities as exact numerical optimization concepts.

## Mandatory shared charter — read before acting

**Start gate:** Do not start until Astra Ultra/integration owner gives you (a) the accepted **Book III M0/M1 + III-07 Linear Regression** freeze SHA, (b) the actual Book III subdirectory, (c) frozen chapter/trace/fixture/manifest contracts, and (d) an allocated D:-based linked worktree and branch. Refuse to implement against the pre-foundation `325f7bdf` commit or to assume that Book III already exists. Read the frozen contracts and current repository `AGENTS.md`/contributor guidelines before writing.

**Canonical repository:** `/media/mario-geometry/WD_SN7100_NVMe/coding-projects/interactive-books` (Windows: `D:\coding-projects\interactive-books`). Your Linux worktree must live on **the same D: NTFS volume**, under `/media/mario-geometry/WD_SN7100_NVMe/coding-projects/interactive-books-worktrees/`. It must be a `git worktree`, not a separate clone. Do not reuse Book I/II audit worktrees. Confirm `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` points to the canonical `.git`, initial HEAD equals the integrator's freeze SHA, and your worktree starts clean.

**Ownership:** You own only your assigned Part's chapter-specific prose, mathematical kernels, deterministic local fixtures, Python/NumPy references, unit/parity/oracle tests, Part-local visuals, and Part-local documentation. Use the directory layout actually frozen by M1. Do not invent or rename platform directories. Treat the global chapter index, landing page/Part navigation, shared trace player, shared inspectors, styles, package files, top-level `.gitignore`, other Parts, Book I and Book II as **read-only**. Provide proposed changes to shared contracts as a clearly scoped integration request; the integrator owns registration and shared-framework changes. Use Part-local declarative manifests or M1's approved auto-discovery contract, not competing central-index edits.

**Education and computation:** Preserve Book III's Part-first navigation and distinctive ML visual identity. At every major interactive, show the authoritative numeric state, its equation, input provenance, update/decision, output, and relevant vector/tensor shapes. SVG/Canvas is only a projection of numeric state. Provide complete learner-facing chapters, not title-only scaffolds. Include prerequisite links to actual Book II published content via the M1-approved stable anchor resolver; no invented destination URLs. Use deterministic small datasets, seed-controlled experiments, meaningful counterexamples, and transparent assumptions. Explain objective/loss separately from evaluation metrics. Match Book II column-vector math conventions and explicitly document any batch row-matrix convention.

**Canonical code:** Teach the from-scratch mathematics in **Python + NumPy**. TypeScript/browser computations must agree on committed deterministic golden traces. Confirm correctness against a **mathematically independent oracle** (analytic formula, exhaustive enumeration, finite differences, robust linear algebra, or suitable scikit-learn comparison depending on the chapter), not only Python↔TypeScript agreement. Framework/library wrappers come only after the mechanism is visible. No network requirement for core learning; no runtime hosted-model calls.

**Tests and build coordination:** Use the **actual** `package.json` scripts/runner and baseline policy delivered by M1/M2—do not fabricate commands or reported test counts. Run light checks in your own worktree; coordinate ALL expensive compiles, Python-wide test sweeps, Astro production builds, and Playwright/browser/screenshot tests through the integrator's one-at-a-time heavy-validation slot. On Linux, when a heavy run is authorized, wrap the exact validated command with `flock /tmp/interactive-books-heavy-gate.lock -c '...exact command...'`; the integrator must also coordinate any Windows jobs because Linux `flock` does not lock Windows processes. Do not regenerate unrelated screenshot baselines, invoke `--update-snapshots`, install Linux dependencies into Windows `node_modules`/`.venv`, or edit platform-specific browser baselines without approved reasons.

**Security/change boundary:** No changes to canonical `main`, no automatic merge, push, Cloudflare deployment, force push, `git clean`, `git reset --hard`, history rewriting, old `/work/interactive-books` files, or agent histories/memory/sessions/databases. Preserve commit history and test evidence. Never delete an old worktree without integrator approval.

**Deliverable and stop rule:** Return a dedicated Part completion report containing chapter checklist, conceptual/algorithmic design, equations, UI trace inventory, exact files changed, commit SHAs, clean status, precise validation commands and result counts, independent oracle proofs (and tolerances), parity and shape checks, responsive/accessibility results, edge-case coverage, performance observations, baseline changes (expected to be none outside your Part), known limitations and scoped integration requests. Classify **BLOCK / CORRECTION REQUIRED / ACCEPT WITH LIMITATIONS / ACCEPT / FREEZE** as a recommendation; only the independent integrator decides acceptance. **Stop** on foundation-contract drift, shared-file collisions, mathematical/oracle failures, unexplained visual-state divergence or unapproved source/baseline changes. Do not self-declare frozen.

## Owned chapter deliverables

| Chapter | Mechanism and flagship interaction |
|---|---|
| **III-32 — Maximum-Margin Classification** | Drag samples and inspect separator w·x+b=0, signed distances, geometric margin, support-vector constraints and infeasibility. |
| **III-33 — Soft Margins and Regularization Tradeoff** | Adjust C; show hinge loss, ||w||² penalty, margin violations and resulting boundary. |
| **III-34 — Kernel Methods** | Compare linear, polynomial and RBF Gram matrices and toy nonlinear decision boundaries; explain implicit similarities. |

## Part-level flagship experience

Margin laboratory with draggable positive/negative examples, explicit signed functional vs geometric margins, support-vector highlights, and a C control demonstrating soft-margin tradeoffs.

## Required independent numerical oracles and failure cases

1. Tiny separable dataset with analytically known maximum-margin line and support vectors; constraints and objective checked independently.
2. Soft-margin primal or dual consistency and/or comparison against a deterministic established solver, with clear solver scope and tolerance.
3. Exact hinge-loss/subgradient fixture, including margin boundary convention.
4. Kernel Gram symmetry and positive-semidefinite expectations for supported kernels; explicit sample kernel entries verified by arithmetic.
5. Non-separable case must not masquerade as a hard-margin solution.

## Exact scope boundaries

Do not claim the kernel code materializes infinite-dimensional coordinates; avoid fragile visual separators that are disconnected from a real solved objective. Solver choice must be explicit and defensible.

## Exit criteria for this Part

A. All assigned chapters are authored and available through **Part-local manifests** under the frozen foundation, with no unapproved shared-shell or central-index edits. Chapter contents, operations, equations, code, trace and visualization all agree.

B. Per-chapter deterministic datasets and mathematical counterexamples exist, including the cases named above. Python/NumPy canonical references, a separate independent oracle, and browser parity results are captured with tolerances.

C. Keyboard/touch operation and responsive layouts are checked at least at **1440px desktop, 820px tablet, 390px mobile** or the M1-approved reference viewports. No permanent overwhelming chapter sidebar; preserve Part-first navigation.

D. Fast checks pass; any scheduled heavy production/browser checks run through the single integrator-controlled slot. No unrelated screenshot baseline changes.

E. Commit only your Part-owned deliverables to your own branch. Return the final report and stop for independent review; **do not merge or deploy**.
